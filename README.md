This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript error: passing an array of strings to a function that expects a single string. The `greeter` function expects a single string argument, but we're passing it an array of strings.  The solution shows how to correctly handle this scenario by either modifying the function signature to accept an array or by iterating over the array and calling the function for each element.
